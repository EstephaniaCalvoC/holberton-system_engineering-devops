## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What I learned from this project:

* What is a PID
* What is a process
* How to find a processâ€™ PID
* How to kill a process
* What is a signal
* What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored

* A Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.


### [2. Show your Bash PID](./2-show_your_bash_pid)
* A Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

<!--
### [3. Show your Bash PID made easy](./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy)
* A Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.


### [4. To infinity and beyond](./4-to_infinity_and_beyond)
* A Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.


### [5. Don't stop my now!](./5-dont_stop_me_now)
